# Problem 1: Mountain car: 
I have first implemented the mountain car problem using random search. But, it was taking many episodes to reach the score 200. 
I have then implemented it using neural networks and Q-table. Doing so, I could train the car in fewer episodes (150-250).

# Problem 2: Cart pole: 
I have implemented cart pole using random linear search algorithm. 
But, then switched to Q-Learning as it was taking just 142 episodes to train.

# Problem 3: Mountain car cross entropy method: 
I have used neural networks to implement this problem and could achieve the goal in 31 iterations.

# Problem 4: I have listed the algorithms taught in the course.

# Common Observations: 
I have found that by decreasing the discount( gamma) value, we could achieve the goal in fewer episodes. 
Also, increasing the number of steps, increases the reward for the mountain car problem.  

# NOTE:

My GitHub shows all 4 problems uploaded in a span of 1 hour. This is because of the issue that I was facing when uploading files to GitHub.
I was not able to view the text in the file. Later, I have realized that all the headings in jupyter notebook have to be of the format 
'markdown', not 'Heading'. Once I changed this, I was able to successfully view the text in the files.
